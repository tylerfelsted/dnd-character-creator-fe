## About
This project was completed as a final Capstone Project for the Spring Board Software Engineering Career Track. It was built using JavaScript and React. The backend was created with Node.JS and Express. The data is stored with MongoDB.

This is a basic character creator for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. Users can log in and create new charactors according to the rules of D&D. The character creation page allows for users to choose a name, level, race, and class for their character. They can then input their ability scores for each of the 6 abilities. After creating a character, a user can view the complete details for their character, including ability and skill modifiers, HP, and proficiency bonus.
